Solitaire is a game played on a chessboard 8x8. The rows and columns of the chessboard are numbered from 1 to 8, from the top to the bottom and from left to right, respectively.

There are four identical pieces on the board. In one move it is allowed to:

    move a piece to an empty neighboring field (up, down, left or right),
    jump over one neighboring piece to an empty field (up, down, left or right).

Exactly 4 moves are allowed for each piece in the figure above. As an example let's consider a piece placed in the row 4, column 4. It can be moved one row up, two rows down, one column left or two columns right.


Write a program that:

    reads two chessboard configurations from the standard input,
    verifies whether the second one is reachable from the first one in at most 8 moves,
    writes the result to the standard output.

Input 
Input contains several datasets, each of two input lines contains 8 integers a1, a2,..., a8 separated by single spaces and describes one configuration of pieces on the chessboard. Integers a2j - 1 and a2j ( 1$ \le$j$ \le$4) describe the position of one piece - the row number and the column number respectively.

Output 
The output for each dataset should contain one word `YES' if the configuration described in the second input line is reachable from the configuration described in the first input line in at most 8 moves, and one word `NO' otherwise.

Sample Input 

4 4 4 5 5 4 6 5
2 4 3 3 3 6 4 6

Sample Output 

YES
